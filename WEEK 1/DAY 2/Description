Digital Design Synthesis Lab - Week 1 Day 2

Overview
This repository contains hands-on experiments exploring digital design synthesis concepts using Yosys and the SkyWater 130nm technology library. The lab covers timing libraries, synthesis methodologies, flip-flop implementations, and optimization techniques.

Key Experiments

1️⃣ Timing Libraries (.lib)
- File: `sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib`
- Description: Explored the structure and significance of timing libraries in digital design flows
- Key Learnings:
  - PVT corners (Process, Voltage, Temperature)
  - Non-Linear Delay Models (NLDM)
  - Power characterization (dynamic and leakage)
  - Standard cell library organization

2️⃣ Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis
- Files: `multiple_modules.v`, `multiple_modules_heir.v`, `multiple_modules_flat.v`
- Comparison:
  - Hierarchical: Preserves module boundaries, maintains design structure
  - Flat: Removes hierarchies, enables global optimization
- Tools: Yosys with Sky130 standard cell library

3️⃣ Glitch Analysis & Prevention
- Concept: Studied glitches in combinational circuits caused by unequal path delays
- Solution: Implemented flip-flops for glitch filtering using synchronous design practices

4️⃣ Flip-Flop Synthesis & Simulation
Implemented and synthesized three types of D-flip-flops:
- Async Reset: `dff_asyncres.v` - Reset independent of clock
- Async Set: `dff_async_set.v` - Set independent of clock  
- *ync Reset: `dff_syncres.v` - Reset synchronized with clock
- Tools: Icarus Verilog for simulation, Yosys for synthesis

5️⃣ Interesting Optimizations
- Multiplication by 2: Optimized to simple bit-shift operation
- Multiplication by 9: Yosys cleverly implemented as concatenation `{a, a}`
- Demonstration: Showed how synthesis tools optimize arithmetic operations efficiently

## Technical Stack
- Synthesis Tool: Yosys
- Simulation: Icarus Verilog + GTKWave
- Technology: SkyWater 130nm PDK
- Standard Cells: `sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib`
