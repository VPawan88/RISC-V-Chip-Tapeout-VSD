Day 1 – Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis

This document records my learnings and tasks from Day 1 of the India RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program.

Objectives
• Gain a clear understanding of Verilog RTL design and the front-end digital flow
• Explore open-source simulation using Icarus Verilog (iverilog) and waveform analysis in GTKWave
• Learn logic synthesis using Yosys with Sky130 PDKs
• Practice the complete flow: code → simulate → synthesize → analyze

Tasks Done
Studied RTL design principles and the synthesis process
Installed and verified Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, and Yosys tools

Ran sample labs:

Compiled and simulated Verilog design/testbench using:
iverilog design.v testbench.v
./a.out
gtkwave dump.vcd

Performed logic synthesis in Yosys with commands:
yosys
read_liberty <library>
read_verilog design.v
abc -liberty <library>
show

Generated a technology-mapped netlist using Sky130 PDK and verified functionality

Key Takeaways
• Complete flow from RTL coding to gate-level netlist using only open-source tools
• Hands-on experience with iverilog simulation and GTKWave waveform visualization
• Understanding of how Yosys performs logic synthesis and mapping to Sky130 cells
