# BabySoC â€“ Fundamentals of SoC Design & Functional Modelling

## What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?
A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is an integrated circuit that consolidates all major components of a computing or electronic system into a single chip. Instead of multiple separate ICs, an SoC integrates processing, memory, peripherals, and interconnects, making it compact, efficient, and widely used in embedded and consumer devices.

## Components of a Typical SoC
- **CPU (Processor Core):** Executes instructions and controls the system.  
- **Memory:** Stores data and instructions (SRAM, DRAM, Flash).  
- **Peripherals:** Interfaces like UART, SPI, I2C, timers, GPIO.  
- **Interconnect/Bus:** Communication backbone (e.g., AMBA, Wishbone).

## Why BabySoC?
The **BabySoC** is a simplified SoC model for **learning and experimentation**.  
It helps to:  
- Understand the structure of SoCs step by step.  
- Focus on core concepts without unnecessary complexity.  
- Build a strong foundation before working on advanced SoC architectures.

## Role of Functional Modelling
Functional modelling is the **first step before RTL and physical design**.  
It provides:  
- Early **functional verification**.  
- Simulation of **data flow and behavior**.  
- **Waveform visualization** using GTKWave.  
- Faster debugging and **error detection at high level**.  

For BabySoC:  
- **Icarus Verilog** â†’ Simulation  
- **GTKWave** â†’ Waveform Analysis

## Learning Outcomes
- Strong understanding of **SoC fundamentals**.  
- Hands-on practice with **functional modelling tools**.  
- Confidence to move towards **RTL, verification, and physical design**.  

ðŸš€ *BabySoC is the perfect starting point for anyone entering the SoC design journey.*
